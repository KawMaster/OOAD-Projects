# Zoo Simulator
### By Willie Chew and Sricharan Varra

# Goal of program/Comments and Assumptions
Zoo Simulator is supposed to simulate the happening of a zoo. The zoo is home to a animals that range from 10 different species and belong to 4 different famalies(Pachyderm, Feline, Canine, Ursidae). Each species' count in the zoo ranges from 2 to 5 animals. <sup>[1]</sup>A data set of baby names is used to find an appropriate name for each animal that corresponds with their species. A zoo keeper arrives at the zoo everyday and does zoo keeping tasks. All actions of the zoo keeper and reactions from the animals were recorded via text and outputed to the *dayatthezoo.out* file. 

# Issues Encountered
When developing this program, the only real issue encountered was developing the program in Java. Our team had little prior knowledge and experience with Java and a few hours were spent understanding Java syntax, arrays, file i/o, and inheritance subtleties. 

# Running the program
Using a code runner, we reccomend IntelleJ, navagate to the *Project 1/* directory and build the project. Once built, run the *main.java*. If using IntelleJ, this can be accomplished by finding it in the file explorer in IntelleJ and right clicking it. A run option should then be offered.
